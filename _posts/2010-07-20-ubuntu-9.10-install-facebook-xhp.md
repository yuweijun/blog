{% highlight bash %}
$> php -r 'echo "XHP!\n"; exit; <a />;'
{% endhighlight %}

1. `xhp.idx_expr = {1 | 0} (default: 0)`: This is a bonus feature of XHP which adds support for the [] operator on the return value of a function. If you enable this you will be able to write code like foo()['bar'] without hitting syntax errors. This configuration is mainly around to fix a personal annoyance with PHP's grammar, and has nothing to do with XHP's core features.

1. `xhp.include_debug = {1 | 0} (default: 1)`: You can disable XHP node annotations by turning this setting off. This may in some cases marginally increase performance of XHP-heavy code. It is highly recommended that you leave this on, as tracking errors in XHP applications is very difficult without annotations.
